# PhD-thesis-appendix
This is the digital appendix to my PhD thesis. Additional code used for data analysis may be published here in the future.

## Content:
1. [Device fabrication process details](device_fabrication.md)
2. [QmeQ setup to calculate currents through a QD with three spin-degenerate resonances](QmeQ_QD_3SpinDegLevels.py)
3. [QmeQ vs classic rate equations comparison for a single QD including one spin degenerate resonance](QmeQ_RateEq_QD_SingleSpinDegLevel.py)
4. [QmeQ setup to calculate currents through a DQD with one spin-degenerate level on each QD, including electron-phonon scattering](QmeQ_DQD_SingleSpinDegLevel.py)
